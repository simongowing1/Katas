All my kata solutions from Codewars, HackerRank and other coding challenges.

# Kater Klub
After the end of the Ironhack bootcamp, I started Kater Klub with some of my fellow students.
We wanted to keep training together, so each day we meet at 10am online and each solve a couple of challenges. If one of us has a problem, we all help.

'Kater' is the German word for hangover, which seemed like an appropriate name for something that gives you a headache in the morning!
